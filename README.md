This project presents a machine learning case study focused on predicting the risk of diabetes using patient health data. The notebook walks through a comprehensive data science pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

📌 Key Highlights:
Dataset: Utilizes a diabetes-related health dataset with relevant patient features.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Goal: Build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of diabetes.

🚀 How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Open the notebook Case_Study_DiabetesRisk_Prediction.ipynb.
Run all cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and results.

🔍 Insights:
Feature importance and correlation analysis revealed key factors contributing to diabetes.
Ensemble models showed improved performance over baseline models.
The project provides a solid base for deploying a risk prediction system in healthcare settings.
